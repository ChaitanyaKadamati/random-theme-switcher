# Icon Placeholder

For marketplace publication, you'll need to add an icon file. Create a 128x128 PNG file named `icon.png` in the root directory.

The icon should represent theme switching - consider:
- A palette icon with arrows
- Multiple colored circles with rotation arrows  
- A brush with color swatches
- A gear with color themes

You can use tools like:
- Figma (free)
- Canva (free templates)
- GIMP (free)
- Or find a suitable icon from free icon libraries like Feather Icons, Heroicons, etc.

Once you have the icon, replace this file with the actual `icon.png`.
